# About Me

<img src="/images/huanghongyi.png" class="floatpic" width="200" height="200">
My name is Huang Hongyi.  I am a senior student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
I am interested in many directions in theoretical condensed matter physics, including high Tc superconductivity, topological insulator, magnetism of material(waiting for further revision!!!)

## Research Interests

- Magnetism(waiting for further revision!!!)

We use spin-fermion model to understand the noble antiferromagnetic order in vacancy-order iron selenide.
